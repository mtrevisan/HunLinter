Hunspeller
==========

## Motivation
I created this project in order to help me construct my hunspell language files (particularly the Venetan language, you can find some tools [here](http://parnodexmentegar.orgfree.com/)). I mean `.aff` and `.dic` files, along with spellchecking and thesaurus.

The name I give to the project is temporary...

## Whant the application do
This application is able to do many correctness checks about the files structure and content. It is able to tell you if some rule is missing or redundant. You can also test hyphenation and eventually add rules. It is also able to manage thesaurus.
