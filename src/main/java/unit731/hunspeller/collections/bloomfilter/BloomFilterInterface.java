/**
 * A simple Bloom filter contract.
 * Bloom Filter is a probabilistic data structure for set membership check. Bloom Filters are
 * highly space efficient when compared to using a HashSet. Because of the probabilistic nature of
 * bloom filter false positive (element not present in bloom filter but contains() says true) are
 * possible but false negatives are not possible (if element is present then contains() will never
 * say false). The false positive probability is configurable. Lower the false positive probability,
 * greater is the space requirement.
 * Bloom filters are sensitive to number of elements that will be inserted in the bloom filter.
 * During the creation of bloom filter expected number of entries must be specified. If the number
 * of insertions exceed the specified initial number of entries then false positive probability will
 * increase accordingly.
 * Internally, this implementation of bloom filter uses Murmur3 fast nonâ€“cryptographic hash
 * algorithm. Although Murmur2 is slightly faster than Murmur3 in Java, it suffers from hash
 * collisions for specific sequence of repeating bytes. Check the following link for more info
 * https://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/MurmurHash2Flaw
 * For a description see here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom Filter</a>.
 *
 * Cheat sheet:
 *
 * m: total bits
 * n: expected insertions
 * k: number of hashes per element
 * b: m/n, bits per insertion
 * p: expected false positive probability
 *
 * 1) Optimal k = b * ln(2)
 * 2) p = (1 - e^(-k * n/m))^k
 * 3) For optimal k: p = 2^(-k) ~= 0.6185^b
 * 4) For optimal k: m = -n * ln(p) / ln^2(2)
 *
